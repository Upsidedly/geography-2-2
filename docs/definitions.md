## B

### Biome

A biome is a regional or worldwide collection of flora and fauna that is distinguished by its vegetation, wildlife, and climate. This would be the case in the desert, where plants and animals thrive despite the severe heat and lack of precipitation.

## C

### Carnivore

An animal that consumes (and can survive upon) other animals predominantly.

## D

### Decomposer

An organism that decomposes organic matter, particularly a soil bacterium, fungus, or invertebrate.

## F

### Food Chain

A sequence of species that are reliant on one another for sustenance.

### Food Web

A food web is the natural interconnectedness of food chains and a visual presentation of what consumes the other in an ecological community.

## H

### Herbivore

An animal that consumes (and can survive upon) plants predominantly.

## O

### Omnivore

An animal that consumes (and can survive upon) animal and plant matter alike (this includes algae, fungi, and bacteria).

## P

### Primary Consumer

The initial consumer in the food chain, which is often a herbivore.

### Primary Producer

The organism or plant upon which all other organisms in a food chain are reliant upon for nutrients.

### Producer

Producers are organisms found at the lowest level of the food chain who synthesize their own foods. Green plants are producers which make their own food via photosynthesis.

## S

### Secondary Consumer

The significant proportion of secondary consumers are carnivores that feed on primary consumers, or herbivores. Additional members of this category are omnivores, which consume main consumers and producers respectively.

## T

### Trophic Level

The level on a food chain in which nutrients is exchanged.
