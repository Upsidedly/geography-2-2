# Weather and Climate

## Weather vs Climate
### Weather
- Daily changes in the physical conditions of the atmosphere: moisture, temperature, pressure, wind, etc.
- Controlled by solar energy which controls winds which push moisterure& temperature around the planet

### Climate
- Long term patterns of weather in a particular area.
- Undergo cyclic changes over decades, centureiesand millenia.

## Elements of Weather

### Temperature

Temperature, or the hotness or coldness of a substance is measured with a thermometer in degrees celsius or degrees fahrenheit. A thermometer is usually made from a tube of hollow glass with a bulb shaped base. the bulb is filled with a liquid, usually mercury which expands as temperatures rise and falls as temperatures drop.

 maxiumum mnimum thermometer measures both the highest (maximum) and lowest (minimum) temperature over a period of time, usually one day (24 hours). There are two markers, one for the maxiumum temperature and one for the minimum. Mercury in the tube pushes the markers as temperates go up or down.

## Stevenson Screen

To make sure that the thermometer is measuring the temperature of the surrounding air, it must be shaded from direct sunlight and should have sufficient air circulating around it. The Stevenson Screen was designed by Thomas Stevenson to create an enclosure with as near as possible temperature as the air outisde. 

The Stevenson Screen is a wooden box with slatted sides, a sloping roof and legs to keep the screen of the ground. it is painted white to reflect the son and it has opening doors whichn lcan e locked for security.

## Altitude and Temperature
**Altitude**: Height above sea level

The atmosphere is heated not directly by the sun rays but by the heat given form the land as terrestrial energy. this terrestrial energy is absorbed by the air above the land. themerature decreases as altitude increases.

In higher altitudes, the air is less dense or thinner (contains less water vapour, dust paricles and gasses), less compact, and has a lesser ability to absorb heat, allowing for lower temperatures

In lower altitudes, the air is dense, more compact, and has a hgher ability to absorb heat, allowing for higher temperatures.

### Environmental Lapse Rate

Environmental Lapse Rate (ELP) - Temperature decreases at a rate of 0.65 degrees Celcius per `100m`.

Example Question:
If the temperature at sea level (`0m`) is 28 degrees celcius, what would it be at the top of a mountain `1700m` high.

#### Step 1: Calculate how many times the altitude increases by 100m 
`1700 ÷ 100 = 17`

#### Step 2: Multiply the amount by the ELP (0.65) to find the temperature difference
`17 x 0.65 = 11.05`

#### Step 3: Subtract the temperature difference to the base temperature
`28 - 11.05 = 16.95`

**Answer** = 16.95°C


## Fun Facts
Temperature decreases the further you are from the equator
