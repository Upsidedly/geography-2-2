## Protractor
This is an instrument used to find angular bearings. It must be held vertical and read in a clockwise direction starting at 0.

The line respesenting `0` and `180 degrees` must run along the vertical line drawn through the location that you are standing and the `90 degree` line that runs along the horizontal line toward the east.

## Finding Angular Bearings

### Step 1:
Identify your two locations.

### Step 2:
Identify your starting point. This usually comes after the word **from** in the question. Eg.

> What is the bearing of the hospital **from** the school

The starting point is the school.

### Step 3:
Draw a vertical line and a horizontal line through the center point of the starting location, to represent a 4-point compass.
