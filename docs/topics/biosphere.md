> A sphere is a realm an area which is limited in extent but within which something is effective (Audrey Clark 1990)

There are 4 spheres on Earth.
- **Atmosphere** (Air)
- **Hydrosphere** (Water)
- **Lithosphere** (Land)
- **Biosphere** (Living things)

Biotic and abiotic instances co-exist. Biotic organisms cannot survive without abiotic.

Biosphere is a part of the 3 other spheres, and is a sum of all ecosystems on earth.

The differenc between the ecosystem and the biosphere is that the biosphere is all biotic organisms on earth, whilst the ecosystem is a biological community with interacting organisms

Biomes
- Tropical Rainforest
  - eg. Amazon
  - Gets alot of rainfall
  - Water streams from mountains
  - Found in the tropical zone
- Temperate Rainforest (found in the temperate zone, experiences seasons)
- Boreal Rainforest (usually)
  - Found in the colder climatic regions (polar)
  - Has winter all year
- Desert
  - Very dry
- Savanna
  - Transition from desert to Rainforest
  - Not as wet as rainforest and not as dry as desert
- Grassland
  - The grassland is more wet than the Savanna but not as wet as the rainforest
  - Because of this state of somewhat wetness it can support grass.
- Marine (Ocean)
- Freshwater (Streams, Rivers, Lakes)
- Tundra

All parts of the ecosystem are interconnected, being flows of energy and nutriets. The ecosystem represents a balance cycle of inputs & outputs. The balance is occasionally disrupted by natural events such as volcanic eruptions, hurricanes and wildfires. Over the last few centuries, the appearance of disruptions has become more frequent due to human activities (eg. overfishing, deforestation), and usually more disasterous aswell.
