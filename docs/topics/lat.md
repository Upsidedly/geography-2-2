# Longitude and Time

**Centre Point** Greenwich/Prime Meridian

**15 degrees** = 1 hour
**1 degree** = 4 minutes

The sun rises in the east and sets in the west, so places on the east are ahead of the prime meridian meaning their time is ahead, and places in the west are behind, making their time behind.
The prime meridian is always at 0 degrees.

East = Add
West = Subtract

### Model Question 1
#### Step 1: Calculate time difference
45/15 = 3 hours (time difference)

#### Step 2: Calculate the actual time

You would add 3 hours to 12 noon because the the country is located in the east, making their time ahead.
3 hours ahead of 12 noon is 3:00 PM


### Model Question 2:
What is the time in country B (located on 76 degrees East) if the time at Greenwich is 12 noon?

#### Step 1: Calculate time difference
76/15 = 5 hours (remainder 1 degree)
That makes it 5 hours and 4 minutes

#### Step 2: Calculate the actual time
You would subtract 5 hours and 4 minutes to 12 noon because the country is located in the west, making their time behind.
5 hours and 4 minutes behind 12 noon is 6:54 AM


## Places in the Same Hemisphere

EAST

Model Question 3:
If it is 3pm at 45 degrees East what time will it be at 75 degrees East?

> Step 1: Calculate difference in degrees
75 - 45 = 30 degrees difference

> Step 2: Calculate difference in time
30 degrees / 15 = 2 hours

> Step 3: Calculate actual time
The time at 75 degrees east is 2 hours ahead because it is further east.
3pm + 2 hours = 5 PM

WEST

Model Question 4:
If it s 5pm 35 degrees West, what time will it be at 90 degrees West.

> Step 1: Calculate difference in degrees
90 - 35 = 55 degrees

> Step 2: Calculate difference in time
55/ 15 = 3 hours (10 degrees leftover)
Making it 3 hours and 40 minutes

> Step 3: Calculate actual time
The time at 90 degrees west is 3 hours and 4 minutes behind because it is further west.
5 PM - 3 hours & 40 minutes = 1:20 PM

PLACES ACROSS HEMISPHERES

Model Question 5:
If it is 6pm at 45 degrees east, what time will it be at 60 degrees west?

> Step 1: Calculate difference in degrees
45 + 60 = 105

> Step 2: Calculate time difference
105 / 15 = 7 hours

> Step 3: Calculate the actual time at  60 degrees west
We subtract because we are going west.
6 PM - 7 hours = 11 AM
