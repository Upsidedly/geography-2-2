# ðŸŒ³ Equitorial Rainforest

#### Transpiration
Plants release water vapour in response to sunlight exposure

## Requirements
1. Bordered by a large water body
   - Aids in the constant rainfall and by extension the rapid plant growth
2. 0-10 degrees north or south of the equator
3. Constant convectional rainfall
4. Warm temperatures all year round

## Examples
- Hawaiian rainforests
- Amazon rainforest
- Atlantic forest
- 

Equitorial rainforests have no dry seasons. There is no drought nor summer.

## Characteristics and Adaptation of Equatorial Rainforest Plants
#
### Leaves
- Large
  - Done for trapping as much sunlight as possible
  - Allows for as much **transpiration** as possible
- Drip tips
  - Predominantly to drain excess water on the leaf
  - For distribution of the water
  - Used for protection of the leaf so during heavy rainfall it doesn't break
- Leathery
  - It's more tearproof and resistant against the constant rainfall
  - More durable leaves and waterproof
### Tree bark
Absorbs alot of moisture due to constant rainfall so it is easily tearable and easily deteriorates
### Roots
- Large to account for size of tree

## 5 mark question
Q: Equitorial rainforests have rapid growth and rapid decay making it have alot of humus in the soil, making it very fertile. However, in reality it isn't very nutrience rich. Why is this so?

A: There is **nutrience leeching**. This occurs because of the constant heavy rainfall that washes nutrience deep into the soil, making it difficult for plant roots to access it.
